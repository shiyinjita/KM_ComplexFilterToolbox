Added go realization files to implement 64 channel filter bank of FltrBnk_1_6_0e.m. Also, FltrBnk_1_6_0e.m was modified to output suitable yaml file describing filter coefficients that go program needs to load. Go realization is about 19 times faster than Matlab (without using concurency - this is next)
