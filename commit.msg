Final commit before ISCAS 2019. Fixed some bugs in approximation. Added bessel filters but just for real case; will start complex case shortly. Also, added equi-ripple group delay approximation but again, have only gotten to real cased, but have the case of finite transmission zeros. This is a development in progress. Have not started on cleaning up directories and files; will do this after current development. For ISCAS, a good starting point is to run the file csc_fltr_1_8_1.m or csc_fltr_1_12_0.m as examples, and follow subroutines down hierarchy. Until the clean-up and better documentation is done, using this toolbox will take some effort. Good Luck!
