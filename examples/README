cscFltr_1_2_0.m: This example was an early attempt at designing SS ladder filters; it works
    but has high sensitivities; the cascade filter is fine

    Includes the first SFG ladder simulation

dfltr_1_8_0.m: This example, has been deprecated by csc_fltr_1_8_0.m and
    DLddrFltr_1_8_0.m. This particular approach has way too much stop-band
    sensitivity; a superior approach has been found; still this approach is
    interesting and could lead to alternative algorithms in the future
dfltr_1_8_0b.m: An early example, now deprecated
dfltr_2_6_2.m: discrete-time filter that is a positive-pass filter
    over most of the positive frequencies and has stop-band attenuation
    specifications chosen to give significant attenuation at the
    corresponding negative image frequencies.
